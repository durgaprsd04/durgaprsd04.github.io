<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>First let me brief you with arch philosophy.Any ubuntu or Linux Mint user might have come across system monitor and all those processes running in them at least one time in their entire period of usage.But none bothered to ask do we really need all these programs. And it is quite surprising to know that ubuntu comes with a lot of software that many of us won't be using. So what is the point of having it installed in the first place. Ubuntu is a good distro for starters , but if you want control over your system and want to make things minimalistic arch is the distro for you.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>As pointed out earlier the entire installation process is done via a console. At this point the only guide for you is either  'elinks'  browser or your memory.</p>
<h3 id="post-installation">Post Installation</h3>
<p>This is maybe the difficult part where you have to configure your entire system for your use. A GUI interface a window manager or desktop environment that suits your need and gives you comfort could be installed along with the programs that you might need.</p>
<h3 id="who-this-guide-is-for">Who this guide is for ?</h3>
<p>When I installed arch linux I just read the arch wiki and only the arch wiki. There is nothing that they miss and the only problem with arch wiki is that if you want to make your system like the one you see on many blogs you have to read through a lot of material and trust me that is a lot to read.But it ultimately pays off but most of these things you don't want if you want to have a quick setup all arranged for you.That is what I provide.</p>
